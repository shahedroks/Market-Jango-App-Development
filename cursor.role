🔧 Developer Profile & Working Rules

Developer Identity

I am a skilled cross-platform mobile developer with strong expertise in Flutter and solid experience in React Native and React.

Assume that I already understand core programming concepts, state management, API integration, and common mobile app architectures.

Flutter Expertise

I am highly proficient in Flutter and Dart.

I can read, understand, and write clean, scalable Flutter code on my own.

I prefer production-ready, maintainable, and well-structured Flutter code (widgets separation, clear folder structure, reusable components, etc.).

When you generate Flutter code for me, focus on:

Best practices (clean code, separation of concerns, proper naming).

Readable, well-formatted Dart code with short, clear comments only where needed.

Avoid over-explaining basic Flutter concepts unless I explicitly ask.

React / React Native to Flutter Conversion

I know React and React Native well enough to understand components, hooks, props, navigation, and styling.

I can convert React / React Native components, screens, or entire flows to Flutter.

Your job is to help me translate any React / React Native code or design into idiomatic Flutter, including:

Converting JSX/TSX components into Flutter widgets.

Mapping styles (StyleSheet, Tailwind, styled-components, etc.) into Flutter’s layout and styling system.

Recreating UI/UX as closely as possible to the original design.

When converting:

Keep the same structure and logic, but use Flutter best practices.

Suggest improvements where Flutter offers a better or more native approach.

Clearly show how props/state/hooks in React/React Native map to Flutter variables/state management.

API Integration & Data Flow

I am comfortable working with REST APIs and JSON data.

I often connect Flutter apps to backends that were originally used in React/React Native apps.

When helping with API integration:

Show me how to connect Flutter UI to APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Use clean patterns for data fetching, error handling, and loading states.

If relevant, suggest suitable state management approaches (e.g., Riverpod, Provider, Bloc, etc.), but don’t overcomplicate unless needed.

Keep the code ready for real-world use (proper models, parsing, and error handling).

Customization & Code Quality

For every project, I prioritize code quality, performance, and maintainability.

When you generate or refactor code:

Avoid unnecessary complexity and duplication.

Make the code easy to extend and reuse.

Follow consistent naming conventions and folder structures.

You may suggest:

Better architecture (e.g., feature-based structure, clean architecture).

Improvements in performance, readability, and UX.

How You Should Assist Me (Cursor Role)

Treat me as a capable Flutter developer who needs:

Faster conversion from React/React Native to Flutter.

Help writing clean, production-ready Flutter code.

Guidance and examples for complex parts, not basic tutorials.

When I paste code or explain a screen/flow:

First, understand the intent and existing structure.

Then, provide direct, clear, and optimized Flutter solutions.

If something is ambiguous, make reasonable assumptions and proceed with a best-practice solution rather than over-explaining basics.
